// Here's the equivalent Swift code for the given Kotlin source code:
// ```swift
// Comments

// This is an end-of-line comment

/* This is a block comment
   on multiple lines. */

/* The comment starts here
/* contains a nested comment */
and ends here. */
// ```
// In Swift, comments are denoted by `//` for single-line comments and `/* */` for multi-line comments. In the above code, the first line is an end-of-line comment, while the second and third lines are block comments spanning multiple lines.
