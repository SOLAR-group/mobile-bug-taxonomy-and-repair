//  The Kotlin code is a simple example of classes and instances in Kotlin, with some inheritance involved. Here's the equivalent code in Swift:

// ```swift
// Classes and Instances
class Rectangle {
        var height: Double = 0.0
        var length: Double = 0.0
        var perimeter: Double { return (height + length) * 2 }
}

open class Shape {
        init(height: Double, length: Double) {
                self.height = height
                self.length = length
        }
}

class RectangularShape: Shape {
        override init(height: Double, length: Double) {
                super.init(height: height, length: length)
        }
        var perimeter: Double { return (height + length) * 2 }
}

class Tshirt {
        var color: String? = nil
        func getDescription() -> String {
                return "This Tshirt is \(color!)"
        }
}

open class Clothing {
        init(size: String, color: String) {
                self.size = size
                self.color = color
        }
        var size: String? = nil
        var color: String? = nil
}

class Jeans: Clothing {
        init(brand: String, size: String, color: String) {
                super.init(size: size, color: color)
                self.brand = brand
        }
        var brand: String? = nil
}
// ```
// Note that in Swift, classes are declared with the `class` keyword instead of `open class`. Additionally, properties and methods in Swift are marked as `lazy var` to indicate that they can be initialized later, whereas in Kotlin, properties are by default `val` which means they are immutable.
