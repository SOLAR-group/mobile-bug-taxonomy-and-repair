//Here is the equivalent Swift code for the two functions:
//```kotlin
// Printing
func printing() {
    print("Hello, world!")
}

// Line printing
func linePrinting() {
    print("Hello, world!\n")
}
//```
//Note that in Swift, we use `print` instead of `println`, and the `println` function is not
//available. Also, we need to use double quotes around the string to print it, since single
//quotes are used for character literals.
