//Here is the translation of the given Kotlin code into Swift:
//```swift
// Source Code:
// package test.me

import Foundation

@objc
protocol MyProtocol {
    var name: String { get set }
}
//```
//In Swift, there is no direct equivalent to Kotlin's `annotation` keyword, but you can use
//the `@objc` attribute on a protocol to make it available for Objective-C interoperability.
//The `@objc` attribute marks the protocol as an Objective-C protocol and allows it to be used
//in Objective-C code.
//
//Also, note that Kotlin uses the `import` keyword to import packages, while Swift uses the
//`import Foundation` statement to import the Foundation framework, which is a set of
//pre-defined types and functions that provide core functionality for iOS and macOS
//development.
