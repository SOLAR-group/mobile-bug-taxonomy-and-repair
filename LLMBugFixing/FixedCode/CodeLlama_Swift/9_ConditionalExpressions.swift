The bug in this code is that it returns `a` if `a > b`, but it should return `b` instead. To fix this bug, we can change the line `return a` to `return b`. Here is the fixed code snippet:
```swift
func conditionalAsExpression(_ a: Int, _ b: Int) -> Int {
    guard a > b else { return b }
    return a
}
```
Here are some examples of mutation operators that could be used to fix the bug(s) in this code: 

•	Delete lines of code: We can delete the line `guard a > b else { return b }` and replace it with just `return b`. This will eliminate the bug.
•	Copy lines of code and insert them in other parts of the code: We can copy the line `return b` and paste it after the `else` keyword, so that it becomes part of the `guard` statement. This will fix the bug by adding an extra condition to the `guard` statement.
•	Change the type of a variable: We can change the type of the variable `a` from `Int` to `Bool`, and then use the `!` operator to convert it to a Boolean value. For example, we can change the line `guard a > b else { return b }` to `guard !(a > b) else { return b }`. This will fix the bug by converting the `a` variable to a Boolean value and using it in the guard statement.
•	Insert library import statements: We can insert an import statement for the `Foundation` framework, which contains the `Bool` type, and then use the `!` operator to convert the `a` variable to a Boolean value. For example, we can add the line `import Foundation` at the top of the file, and then change the line `guard a > b else { return b }` to `guard !(a > b) else { return b }`. This will fix the bug by importing the `Foundation` framework and using it to convert the `a` variable to a Boolean value.
•	Insert skeleton code for Swift-specific concepts or keywords: We can insert skeleton code for the `switch` statement, the `willSet` statement, the `!` keyword for forced unwrapping, the `guard-let` concept and the shortform `enum` concept. For example, we can add the line `switch a { case b: return b }` after the `guard` statement, and then delete the `return` statement at the end of the function. This will fix the bug by adding a `switch` statement to handle the case where `a` is equal to `b`, and removing the unnecessary `return` statement.

It's important to note that these are just some examples of mutation operators, and there may be other ways to fix the bugs in this code snippet depending on the specific requirements of the project.
