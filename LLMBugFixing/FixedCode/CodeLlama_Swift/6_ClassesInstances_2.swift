To fix the bug in this code snippet, you need to add a super.init() call to the init method of RectangularShape class. Here is an example of how the code could look after fixing the bug:
class RectangularShape: Shape {
        override init(height: Double, length: Double) {
                super.init(height: height, length: length)
        }
        var perimeter: Double { return (height + length) * 2 }
}
In this example, a super.init() call is added to the RectangularShape class's init method to ensure that all necessary properties are set during initialization. This resolves the bug in the original code snippet by ensuring that the height and length properties are properly initialized.
