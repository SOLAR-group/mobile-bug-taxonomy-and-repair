  The code snippet has one bug that needs to be fixed. In the Jeans class init method, a super.init(size: size, color: color) call is missing. Here's the fixed version of the code snippet:
```
class Clothing {
    init(size: String, color: String) {
        self.size = size
        self.color = color
    }
    var size: String? = nil
    var color: String? = nil
}

class Jeans: Clothing {
    init(brand: String, size: String, color: String) {
        super.init(size: size, color: color)
        self.brand = brand
    }
    var brand: String? = nil
}
```
