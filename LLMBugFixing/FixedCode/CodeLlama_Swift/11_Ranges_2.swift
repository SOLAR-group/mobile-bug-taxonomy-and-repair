func outOfRange(list: [String]) -> Bool {
    return list.count > list.indices.endIndex
}

Here are some examples of mutation operators that could be used to fix the bug(s) in the code: 

•	Delete lines of code.
•	Copy lines of code and insert them in other parts of the code.
•	Change the type of a variable.
•	Insert library import statements.
•	Insert skeleton code for Swift-specific concepts or keywords, such as the ‘switch’ statement, the ‘willSet’ statement, the ‘!’ keyword for forced unwrapping, the ‘guard-let’ concept and the shortform ‘enum’ concept.
