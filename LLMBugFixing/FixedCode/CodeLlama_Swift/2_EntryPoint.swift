The Swift code snippet you provided is not a complete function, it just prints "Hello, World!" to the console. To fix the bug(s) in this code we need to wrap the `print` statement with a function that takes a parameter and returns the fixed code:
```
func greet(_ name: String) {
    print("Hello, \(name)!")
}
```
Alternatively, if you want to use mutation operators, here's an example of how you could fix the code using the delete line operator:
```
func greet(_ name: String) {
    // Delete the second parameter
    print("Hello, \(name)!")
}
```
Here's another example using the copy and insert lines operators:
```
func greet(name: String) {
    let greeting = "Hello, \(name)"
    print(greeting)
}
```
Note that this code uses a variable `greeting` to store the string concatenation of "Hello" and `name`, then prints it using the `print()` function.
