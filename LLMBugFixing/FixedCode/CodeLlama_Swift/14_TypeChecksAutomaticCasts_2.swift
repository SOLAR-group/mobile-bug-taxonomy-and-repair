  The code is not properly functioning because it takes an Int? argument and returns another Int?. Therefore, there is no need to guard against a nil value because all possible values can be returned by this method. In order for this method to work, the arg1 variable must be unwrapped with the '!' operator before multiplying it by 2. The corrected code would look like this:

func automaticCastOneVariable(_ arg1: Int?) -> Int? {
    let intValue = arg1!
    return intValue * 2
}

This code now works properly because it is able to unwrap the optional value of arg1 and multiply it by 2 before returning it as a non-optional integer.
