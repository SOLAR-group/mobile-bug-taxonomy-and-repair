This is a Swift code snippet that contains one bug. 
Fix the bug in the code and return the fixed code snippet.func iterateOverProgression() -> Int {
    var testValue = 0

    for x in 10 ..< 1 where x % 3 == 0 {
        testValue += x
    }

    return testValue
}
Here are some examples of mutation operators that could be used to fix the bug(s) in the code: 
•	Delete lines of code. 
•	Copy lines of code and insert them in other parts of the code. 
•	Change the type of a variable. 
•	Insert library import statements.
•	Insert skeleton code for Swift-specific concepts or keywords, such as the ‘switch’ statement, the ‘willSet’ statement, the ‘!’ keyword for forced unwrapping, the ‘guard-let’ concept and the shortform ‘enum’ concept.

The bug in the code is that the range of numbers being iterated over is wrong. The correct range is 3 ..< 10, not 10 ..< 1. So, the corrected code snippet would be:
func iterateOverProgression() -> Int {
    var testValue = 0

    for x in 3 ..< 10 where x % 3 == 0 {
        testValue += x
    }

    return testValue
}

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any questions.
