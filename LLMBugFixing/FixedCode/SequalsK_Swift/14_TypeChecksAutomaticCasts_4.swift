To fix the bug in the code, we need to make sure that if the arg1 is nil, then the return value is also nil. Here's the fixed version of the code:
```swift
func automaticCastOneVariable(arg1: Int?) -> Int? {
    if arg1 != nil {
        return arg1 * 2
    } else {
        return nil
    }
}
```
We can fix this bug by changing the line `return arg1 * 2` to `return arg1! * 2`, which forces the unwrapping of the optional value. This way, if the arg1 is nil, then the code will return nil without crashing.
