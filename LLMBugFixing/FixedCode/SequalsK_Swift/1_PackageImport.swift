The bug in this code is that it contains a syntax error. The line `let Ꮻpackage = "test.me"` is not valid Swift code because of the use of the character `Ꮻ` (which is a non-ASCII character) as a variable name. In Swift, variable names must be written in ASCII characters only.

To fix this bug, you can replace the character `Ꮻ` with an ASCII character that represents "package" in the language, such as "p". Here's the corrected code:
```
let package = "test.me"
let imports = ["kotlin.annotation.*"]
```
