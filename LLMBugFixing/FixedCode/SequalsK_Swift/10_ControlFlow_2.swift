The bug in the code is that the `case` statements are not properly formed. The `switch` statement expects a pattern to be matched against, but the cases provided are just strings. To fix this, we need to enclose each case in parentheses and provide a type annotation for each case. Here's the fixed version of the code:
```swift
func describe(obj: Any) -> String {
    switch obj {
        case 1:
            "One"
        case ("Hello" as String):
            "Greeting"
        case Long:
            "Long"
        case (String as Any):
            "Not a string"
        default:
            "Unknown"
    }
}
```
Note that we also added an `as` keyword to the first case, since it's a type cast. This is necessary because the `case` statement expects a pattern to be matched against, and the `1` literal is not of type `Any`.
