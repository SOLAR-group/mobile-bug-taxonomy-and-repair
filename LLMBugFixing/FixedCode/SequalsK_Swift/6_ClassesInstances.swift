The corrected code should look like this:

class Rectangle {
    var height: Double
    var length: Double
    var perimeter: Double
    init(height: Double, length: Double) {
        self.height = height
        self.length = length
        self.perimeter = (self.height + self.length) * 2
    }
}

The correction includes the following changes to the code:
â€¢	Added self keyword before all variables and used it to call the variable values in the perimeter initialization expression.

Note that in Swift, when initializing an instance property with a calculated value, we must use self. to refer to the property's current value within the initializer closure.
