The bug in this code is that the `square` and `triangle` variables are set to null initially, but they should be set to the correct values when the object is constructed. The corrected code would look like this:
```kotlin
class TriangleAndSquare {
    var triangle: EquilateralTriangle = EquilateralTriangle(size, name)
        set(newValue) {
            square.sideLength = newValue.sideLength
            field = newValue
        }

    var square: Square = Square(size, name)
        set(newValue) {
            triangle.sideLength = newValue.sideLength
            field = newValue
        }

    constructor(size: Double, name: String) {
        this.square = Square(size, name)
        this.triangle = EquilateralTriangle(size, name)
    }
}
```
In this code, the `square` and `triangle` variables are initialized to the correct values when the object is constructed using the constructor. The `set` functions for these variables set the side length of the other variable and update the field with the new value.
