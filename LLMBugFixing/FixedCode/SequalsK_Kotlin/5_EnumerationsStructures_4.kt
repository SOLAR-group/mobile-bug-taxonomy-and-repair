The bug in this code is that the variable `threeOfSpadesDescription` is not being assigned a value. The function `simpleDescription()` is called on the object `threeOfSpades`, but it does not return anything, so the variable remains uninitialized. To fix this bug, we can modify the code as follows:
```
val threeOfSpades = Card(three, spades)
val threeOfSpadesDescription = threeOfSpades.simpleDescription()
print(threeOfSpadesDescription)
```
This will print the description of the `Card` object `threeOfSpades`.
