The bug in this code is that it uses mutableMapOf to create a map, but does not specify the type of the values in the map. The values are being assigned as strings, but the map was created with no type parameters specified, so it has no idea what type of values should be stored in it.

To fix this bug, you can simply add the type parameter to the mutableMapOf function call:
val map = mutableMapOf<Int, String>("1" to "a", "2" to "b")
This tells the compiler that the values stored in the map are of type String and that the keys are of type Int.
