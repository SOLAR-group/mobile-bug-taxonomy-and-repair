Here are some examples of mutation operators that could be used to fix the bug(s) in the code: 

•	Delete lines of code. 
•	Copy lines of code and insert them in other parts of the code. 
•	Change the type of a variable. 
•	Insert library import statements.
•	Insert skeleton code for Kotlin-specific concepts or keywords, such as the ‘when’ expression, ‘set’ statement, the ‘in’ or ‘!in’ keyword and the ‘?.let’ concept.

The first bug in the code is that it has a redundant else statement which is not required. This can be fixed by deleting the entire else statement. The updated code will look like this: 

// Switch statements
fun switchStatement(vegetable: String): String {
    when (vegetable) {
        "celery" -> return "Add some raisins and make ants on a log."
        "cucumber", "watercress" -> return "That would make a good tea sandwich."
    }
