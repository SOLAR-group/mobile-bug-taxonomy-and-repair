Delete lines of code.
Copy lines of code and insert them in other parts of the code. 
Change the type of a variable. 
Insert library import statements.
Insert skeleton code for Kotlin-specific concepts or keywords, such as the ‘when’ expression, ‘set’ statement, the ‘in’ or ‘!in’ keyword and the ‘?.let’ concept.
The bug is in the 'when' block which does not have a default case. If no condition from the when block is met it will return null. To fix this we can add a default case that returns an empty string. The fixed code would look like this: 
enum class Rank(val rawValue: Int) {
    ace(1),
    two(2), three(3), four(4), five(5), six(6), seven(7), eight(8), nine(9), ten(10),
    jack(11), queen(12), king(13);
    companion object {
        operator fun invoke(rawValue: Int): Rank? = values().firstOrNull { it.rawValue == rawValue }
    }

    fun simpleDescription(): String {
        when (this) {
            ace -> return "ace"
            jack -> return "jack"
            queen -> return "queen"
            king -> return "king"
            else -> return ""
        }
    }
}
