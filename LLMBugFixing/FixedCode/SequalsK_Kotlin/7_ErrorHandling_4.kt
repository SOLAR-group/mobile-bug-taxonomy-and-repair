The bug in this code is that the `fridgeIsOpen` variable is not being updated correctly. The `fridgeIsOpen = false` line is always executed, regardless of whether the fridge is actually open or not.

To fix this bug, we can add a check to ensure that the fridge is actually open before updating its status. Here's the fixed code:
```kotlin
fun fridgeContains(food: String): Boolean {
    var result = false

    if (fridgeIsOpen) {
        result = fridgeContent.contains(food)
    }

    return result
}
```
In this version, we first check if the fridge is open by using an `if` statement to check the value of the `fridgeIsOpen` variable. If the fridge is open, we then use the `contains()` method to see if the food item is in the fridge's content. The result of this operation is stored in a local variable called `result`, which is returned at the end of the function.

Note that we also changed the signature of the `fridgeContains` function to accept a single argument, which is the food item to be checked for in the fridge's content. This makes it easier to use the function with different types of data, such as strings or integers.
