The bug in this code is that it uses the same name for multiple arrays, which is not allowed in Kotlin. To fix the bug, we can rename one of the arrays to avoid the naming conflict. For example, we can rename "arr" to "mArr" or "myList" to avoid the naming conflict. Here's an example of how to fix the code:
```
// Array
val list = arrayOf("a", "b", "c")
val mList = arrayOf("a", "b", "c")
val arr = arrayOf("a", "b", "c")
val myList = arrayOf("a", "b", "c")
```
Alternatively, we can also use the Kotlin's alias syntax to create a new name for the array and avoid the naming conflict. For example:
```
// Array
val list = arrayOf("a", "b", "c")
val mList = arrayOf("a", "b", "c")
val arr = arrayOf("a", "b", "c") as List<String>
val myList = arrayOf("a", "b", "c") as List<String>
```
In this example, we use the `as` keyword to create a new name for the array and assign it to a new variable, which avoids the naming conflict.
