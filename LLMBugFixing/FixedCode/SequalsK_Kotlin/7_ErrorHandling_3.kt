Here is the fixed code snippet:
fun errorCatching(): String {
    try {
        val printerResponse = send(1040, "Bi Sheng")
        return printerResponse
    } catch (error: Exception) {
        return "Error"
    } finally {
        printer.close()
    }
}
Here are some examples of mutation operators that could be used to fix the bug(s) in the code: 

•	Delete lines of code. 
•	Copy lines of code and insert them in other parts of the code. 
•	Change the type of a variable. 
•	Insert library import statements.
•	Insert skeleton code for Kotlin-specific concepts or keywords, such as the ‘when’ expression, ‘set’ statement, the ‘in’ or ‘!in’ keyword and the ‘?.let’ concept.
