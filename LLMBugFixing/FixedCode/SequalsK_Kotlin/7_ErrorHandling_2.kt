The code snippet has a bug in it. The `send` function takes two arguments: a job ID and a printer name. However, in the second `try`-`catch` block, the printer name is passed as an argument with the wrong type. It should be a string, but it is being passed as an integer.

Here's the fixed code snippet with the bug fixed:
```kotlin
fun send(job: Int, @argLabel("toPrinter") printerName: String): String {
    if (printerName == "Never Has Toner") {
        throw PrinterError.noToner
    }

    return "Job sent"
}

val printerSuccess = try {send(1884, "Mergenthaler")} catch(e: Throwable) {null}
val printerFailure = try {send(1885, "Never Has Toner")} catch(e: Throwable) {null}
```
