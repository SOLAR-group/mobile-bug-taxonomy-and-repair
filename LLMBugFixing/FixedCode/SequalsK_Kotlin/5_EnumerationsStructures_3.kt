The bug in the code is that the enum class ServerResponse does not have any associated values with it. The correct syntax for creating an enum class with associated values would be: 

enum class ServerResponse(val result: String, val failure: String) {
    RESULT("Result", "Failure"),
}

Here is the fixed code snippet: 

// Enumerations with associated values
enum class ServerResponse(val result: String, val failure: String) {
    RESULT("Result", "Failure"),
}
