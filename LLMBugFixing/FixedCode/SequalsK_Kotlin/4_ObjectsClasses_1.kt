The bug in this code is that the `numberOfSides` variable is not initialized when it is declared. To fix this, we can initialize it to a default value of 0, like this:
```
open class NamedShape(var name: String) {
    var numberOfSides: Int = 0
    {
        // for cleanup before object is deallocated
    }

    open fun simpleDescription(): String {
        return "A shape with ${numberOfSides} sides."
    }
}
```
Alternatively, we can also use the `lateinit` keyword to indicate that this variable should be initialized later. For example:
```
open class NamedShape(var name: String) {
    lateinit var numberOfSides: Int
    {
        // for cleanup before object is deallocated
    }

    open fun simpleDescription(): String {
        return "A shape with ${numberOfSides} sides."
    }
}
```
It's worth noting that using `lateinit` can make the code more difficult to understand, as it requires additional setup to initialize the variable. Therefore, it's generally a good practice to initialize variables when they are declared, unless there is a specific reason not to do so.
