The following is the fixed code snippet: 
    val explicitDouble = 70.0
The bug in the original code was that the 'explicitDouble' variable was declared but never initialized with a value, which resulted in an error when the code was compiled. The fixed code snippet initializes the 'explicitDouble' variable with a value of 70.0, which eliminates the error and makes the code compilable.
