The bug in this code is that it is attempting to concatenate a String with an Int using the + operator. In Kotlin, this is not allowed as the + operator can only be used for numbers, Strings, or other types that support addition.

To fix the bug, we need to convert the Int value to a String before concatenating it with the label. We can do this by calling the toString() method on the width variable. Here is the fixed code:
```
val label: String = "The width is "
val width: Int = 94
val widthLabel: String = label + width.toString()
val widthLabel2: String = label + width.toString()
```
