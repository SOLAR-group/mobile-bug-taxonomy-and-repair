To fix this bug in the code, we need to change the type of the variable `eight` from an `Int` to a mutable `Int`. This is because we are trying to modify the value of `eight` inside the function `adjust()`, but it has been declared as an immutable `Int`.

Here is the fixed code snippet:
```kotlin
interface Int : ExampleProtocol {
    val simpleDescription: String get() = "The number $this"
    fun adjust() {
        this += 42
    }
}

val seven = 7
val sevenDescription = seven.simpleDescription
var eight = 8

fun makeUseOfExtension() {
    eight.adjust()
}
```
