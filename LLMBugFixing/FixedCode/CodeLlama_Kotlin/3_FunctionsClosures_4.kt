•	Delete lines of code
The code snippet is not complete, so deleting the line containing "return addOne" will result in a syntax error. Therefore, this option should be avoided. 

•	Copy lines of code and insert them in other parts of the code
This option can be used to fix the bug by inserting the function definition of "addOne" into another part of the code where it is needed. However, doing so will require changing the variable name from "number" to something else, as "number" is already being used in the outer function. Therefore, this option should also be avoided. 

•	Change the type of a variable
Changing the type of a variable can cause unintended side effects in the code and may not fix the bug(s) present in the code snippet. Therefore, this option should also be avoided.

•	Insert library import statements
Inserting library import statements can help to resolve dependencies or add new functionality to the code, but it will not fix bugs in the code snippet. Therefore, this option should also be avoided.

• Insert skeleton code for Kotlin-specific concepts or keywords, such as the ‘when’ expression, ‘set’ statement, the ‘in’ or ‘!in’ keyword and the ‘?.let’ concept. 
This option is relevant because it allows us to fix some of the bugs in the code snippet by providing skeleton code for the missing Kotlin features. For example, we can add a 'when' expression to replace the function body of the "addOne" function. We can also insert '?.let' after the lambda parameter and change the return type of the lambda to Unit. The fixed code snippet would be as follows:
fun functionAsReturnType(): ((Int) -> Int) {
    fun addOne(number: Int): Int {
        when (number) {
            1 -> return 2
            else -> return number + 1
        }
    }
    return addOne
}
