Here's the fixed code snippet:
fun functionWithLabel(person: String, on day: String): String {
    return "Hello $person, today is $day."
}

The bug in this code was that the method parameter 'on day' had an incorrect name. It should have been 'on day: String'. The corrected code snippet includes the correct parameter name and returns the expected string.
