fun closure(): List<Int> {
    return numbers.map { number: Int -> 3 * number }
}

This code returns a list of integers that are three times larger than the original list of integers. The `numbers` is an unspecified variable, so we cannot fix this code without knowing what value it holds. In general, this code is not a valid Kotlin snippet because it has undefined variable names. Here are some ways to fix the bug(s) in the code:
•	Delete lines of code: We can remove the return statement and the function definition altogether if we don't need them.
•	Copy lines of code and insert them in other parts of the code: This is a general approach to fixing bugs by finding the issue and correcting it where it occurred, and then copying any necessary sections of code into new locations where they are needed.
•	Change the type of a variable: To fix this bug, we should specify the variable's type. For instance, if the `numbers` variable is a list of integers, then we can change its definition to be: `fun closure(): List<Int> {
    return numbers.map { number -> 3 * number }
}`
•	Insert library import statements: We should import the necessary libraries in order to fix this bug. To do this, we need to know what libraries we need to include. The `when` expression and `set` statement are two examples of Kotlin-specific concepts that require additional library imports. 
•	Insert skeleton code for Kotlin-specific concepts or keywords: This is an advanced approach to fixing bugs in code that involves adding new elements, such as the ‘when’ expression, ‘set’ statement, the ‘in’ or ‘!in’ keyword and the ‘?.let’ concept.
