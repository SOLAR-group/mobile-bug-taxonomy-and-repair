The bug in this code snippet is that it is trying to assign a list of strings to a variable called "fridgeContent" but is using the wrong syntax for doing so. The correct way to assign a list of strings to a variable is by using the "listOf()" function, like this:
```
val fridgeContent = listOf("milk", "eggs", "leftovers")
```
The corrected code snippet would be:
```
val fridgeContent = listOf("milk", "eggs", "leftovers")
println(fridgeContent) // Output: [milk, eggs, leftovers]
```
