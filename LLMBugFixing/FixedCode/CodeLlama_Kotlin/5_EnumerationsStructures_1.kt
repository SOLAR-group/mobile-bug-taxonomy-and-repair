The bug in this code is that it returns "clubs" for all values of Suit except SPADES. Here's the fixed version:
```kotlin
enum class Suit {
    SPADES, HEARTS, DIAMONDS, CLUBS;

    fun simpleDescription(): String = when (this) {
        SPADES -> "spades"
        HEARTS -> "hearts"
        DIAMONDS -> "diamonds"
        else -> "clubs" // should be "CLUBS"
    }
}
```
