The bug in this code is that the SimpleStructure class does not implement the ExampleProtocol interface correctly. It is missing the adjust() method required by the interface. Here is the fixed code snippet:

data class SimpleStructure(private var simpleDescription: String = "A simple structure") : ExampleProtocol {
    override fun adjust() {
        simpleDescription += " (adjusted)"
    }
}
