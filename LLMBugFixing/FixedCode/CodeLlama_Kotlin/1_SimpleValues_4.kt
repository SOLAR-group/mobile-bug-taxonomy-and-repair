The provided Kotlin code snippet contains a bug. The `list` variable is declared as an array of strings but is initialized with a list of characters. This causes a type mismatch error when trying to access the elements of the array.

To fix this bug, we need to convert the list of characters to a list of strings using the `map()` function. Here's the corrected code snippet:
```kotlin
var list = arrayOf("a", "b", "c") // This is correct
```
Now, the `list` variable is initialized with an array of three strings, which matches the expected type.
