The provided code snippet has a bug in it. The error message is: "Type mismatch: inferred type is String but Person was expected". To fix this issue, we need to change the type of the parameter `person` from `String` to `Person`. Here's the corrected code snippet:

fun functionWithOmittedLabel(_ person: Person, day: String) -> String {
    return "Hello $person, today is $day."
}
