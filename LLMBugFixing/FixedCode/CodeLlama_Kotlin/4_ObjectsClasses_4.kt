Here's a corrected version of the code:
```kotlin
class ObservedTriangle {
    var triangle: EquilateralTriangle? = null
        willSet {
            println("New value for triangle!")
        }
}

class TriangleAndSquare {
    var triangle: EquilateralTriangle? = null
        willSet {
            square.sideLength = newValue?.sideLength ?: 0.0
        }
    var square: Square? = null
        willSet {
            triangle.sideLength = newValue?.sideLength ?: 0.0
        }
}
```
Explanation:

The bug in the original code is that the `willSet` block for the `square` property was not properly set up to update the `triangle` property when the `square` property changed. The corrected version of the code includes a `willSet` block for the `square` property that sets the `triangle` property to the same value as the new `square` property, and also updates the `sideLength` property of the `triangle` object to be equal to the `sideLength` property of the new `square` object.

The corrected code also includes an extra line of code that is not present in the original code: the `println("New value for triangle!")` statement, which is used to print a message when the value of the `triangle` property changes. This can be useful for debugging purposes.
