This code contains a bug where the map is initialized with two keys "1" and "2", but their values are not strings as expected. It should be fixed by changing the type of variable from 'String' to 'MutableMap<String, String>', which will allow it to hold other types of data. 

var map: MutableMap<String, String> = mutableMapOf(
            "1" to "a",
            "2" to "b"
    )
