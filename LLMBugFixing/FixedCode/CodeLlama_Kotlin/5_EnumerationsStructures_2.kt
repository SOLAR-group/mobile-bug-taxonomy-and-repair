This is a Kotlin code snippet that contains one bug: it will print the value of the variable "value" instead of the description for the rank. Here's the fixed version of the code:

enum class Rank(val value: Int) {
    ACE(1), TWO, THREE, FOUR, FIVE, SIX, SEVEN, EIGHT, NINE, TEN, JACK, QUEEN, KING;

    fun simpleDescription(): String = when (this.value) {
        1 -> "ace"
        11 -> "jack"
        12 -> "queen"
        13 -> "king"
        else -> this.name
    }
}

The bug was in the last line of the code, where it used 'this.value' instead of 'this.name'. This will print the value of the variable "value", instead of the description for the rank.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any other questions.
