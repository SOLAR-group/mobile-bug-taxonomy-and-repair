Here is a possible fix for the bug in the code:
```
val apples = 5
val oranges = 7

// Multiline String
val quotation: String = """
    I said "I have $apples apples."
    And then I said "I have ${apples + oranges} pieces of fruit."
""".trimIndent()
```
The bug in the original code was that the variable `apples` was not defined before it was used in the String template. The fix is to define the variable `apples` and then use it in the String template. Additionally, the variable `oranges` was also not defined before it was used, so we need to add a line to define that variable as well.
